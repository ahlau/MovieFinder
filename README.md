# MovieFinder app

This is a ReactNative sample app used to demonstrate API fetching. The
API of choice is [The Movie DB](www.themoviedb.org) where one can easily
register for an API key to use in this app. Insert your API key into
`UrlConfiguration.js` in the `API_KEY` variable to get started.

This app is based off of a tutorial from Tom Elliot titled [React Native
Tutorial: Building Apps with
Javascript](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial)
written in April 2016. I mention the date as things seem to change quite
rapidly in the JS space.

To install MovieFinder, make sure you have some essentials. Install 
XCode, install Git, clone the repository and once those are done, have
`react-native` installed through `npm`, and install `node` using HomeBrew.
```
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
```
